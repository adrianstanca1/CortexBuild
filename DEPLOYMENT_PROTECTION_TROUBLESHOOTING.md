# Deployment Protection Troubleshooting

## üî¥ Problem: Still Getting 401 Unauthorized

**Test Result:** API still returns 401 with Vercel SSO authentication page
**Status:** Deployment Protection is still active and blocking requests
**Evidence:** 
- Response: HTML authentication page
- Set-Cookie: `_vercel_sso_nonce`
- Title: "Authentication Required"

---

## üîç Why This Happens

Deployment Protection can be tricky to disable. Common reasons:

1. **Settings didn't save** - Changes weren't persisted
2. **Wrong setting disabled** - Disabled something else instead
3. **Cache issue** - Browser cached the old setting
4. **Propagation delay** - Changes haven't propagated yet
5. **Different protection type** - Multiple protection options exist

---

## ‚úÖ Solution: Use Vercel Protection Bypass Token

Since disabling protection is proving difficult, we'll use a **Protection Bypass Token** instead.

### **Step 1: Get Your Bypass Token**

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Select: CortexBuild project
3. Click: Settings tab
4. Find: **Deployment Protection**
5. Look for: **Bypass Token** or **Create Bypass Token**
6. Click: **Create** or **Generate**
7. Copy: The token (long string)

**Token Format:** Looks like `vercel_bypass_...`

### **Step 2: Update Test Script**

The test script needs to use the bypass token. Here's how:

**Option A: Pass as environment variable**
```bash
VERCEL_BYPASS_TOKEN=your_token_here node test-login-api.js
```

**Option B: Pass as command argument**
```bash
node test-login-api.js https://cortex-build-mcnrk7yba-adrian-b7e84541.vercel.app adrian.stanca1@gmail.com password123 your_token_here
```

### **Step 3: Run Test with Bypass Token**

```bash
VERCEL_BYPASS_TOKEN=vercel_bypass_xxxxx node test-login-api.js
```

## üîÑ Alternative: Disable Protection Properly

If you want to disable protection instead:

### **Verify Deployment Protection is Disabled**

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Select: CortexBuild
3. Settings ‚Üí Deployment Protection
4. **Look for:**
   - Toggle showing "OFF" or "Disabled"
   - No checkmark or indicator showing it's active
   - Status message: "Disabled" or "Off"

### **If Still Enabled:**

1. Click the toggle/button to disable
2. Look for confirmation message
3. **Wait 30 seconds** for changes to propagate
4. Refresh the page (F5)
5. Verify it still shows disabled
6. Try the test again

### **If Changes Won't Save:**

1. Try a different browser
2. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
3. Try incognito/private mode
4. Try from a different device

## üöÄ Recommended Path Forward

**Use the Bypass Token method** - it's more reliable:

1. Get bypass token from Vercel dashboard
2. Run: `VERCEL_BYPASS_TOKEN=your_token node test-login-api.js`
3. Should get 200 OK response
