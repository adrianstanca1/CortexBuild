## 🎉 What Was Fixed

### **Problem**
After successful login, the dashboard crashed with error:
```
Error: column projects.start_date does not exist
```

### **Root Cause**
The API was trying to query columns that don't exist in the projects table:
- ❌ `start_date` - doesn't exist
- ❌ `end_date` - doesn't exist
- ❌ `budget` - doesn't exist
- ❌ `spent` - doesn't exist
- ❌ `project_manager_id` - doesn't exist

### **Solution**
Updated the projects query to only select columns that actually exist in the database:

**Before (incorrect):**
```typescript
.select(`
    id, name, description, status,
    start_date, end_date, budget, spent,  // ❌ Don't exist
    location, company_id, project_manager_id,
    created_at, updated_at
`)
```

**After (correct):**
```typescript
.select(`
    id, name, description, status,
    location, image, company_id,
    contacts, snapshot,
    created_at, updated_at
`)
```
