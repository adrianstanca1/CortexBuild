## üîç Root Cause Analysis

### Issue: Vercel Deployment Protection

The API endpoint is being intercepted by **Vercel Deployment Protection** before it reaches your code.

**Evidence:**
- Response is HTML, not JSON
- Status code is 401 (authentication required)
- Response contains Vercel SSO authentication page
- Set-Cookie header: `_vercel_sso_nonce`
- Page title: "Authentication Required"

**What's Happening:**
1. Request reaches Vercel deployment
2. Vercel checks if user is authenticated
3. User is not authenticated (no Vercel SSO token)
4. Vercel returns 401 with authentication page
5. Request never reaches your `/api/auth/login` endpoint

## üìù Important Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Security Consideration:**
- Deployment Protection is a security feature
- It prevents unauthorized access to your deployment
- After testing, you may want to re-enable it
- Consider using a protection bypass token for automated testing

‚úÖ **Environment Variables:**
- The environment variables ARE set correctly
- They're just not being used because the request is blocked before reaching your code

üîÑ **Redeployment:**
- May not be necessary to disable protection
- But if required, Vercel will prompt you
- Follow the prompts to redeploy
