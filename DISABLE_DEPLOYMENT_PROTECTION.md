## üìù Important Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Security:**
- Deployment Protection is a security feature
- It prevents unauthorized access to your deployment
- After testing, you may want to re-enable it
- For production, consider using a protection bypass token

‚úÖ **What This Does:**
- Allows API requests to reach your code
- Removes the 401 authentication barrier
- Lets your `/api/auth/login` endpoint handle requests

üîÑ **Redeployment:**
- Usually not needed to disable protection
- If Vercel prompts you, follow the prompts
- Deployment should remain "Ready"

---

## üÜò Troubleshooting

**Can't find Deployment Protection?**
- Make sure you're in Settings tab
- Look in left sidebar
- Try scrolling down
- It might be under "Security" section

**Still getting 401 after disabling?**
- Verify protection is actually disabled
- Check that changes were saved
- Try refreshing the page
- Wait a few seconds for changes to propagate

**Deployment shows error?**
- Click on deployment to see logs
- Look for error messages
- Try redeploying if needed

---

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Disable Deployment Protection** (this page)
2. **Re-run API test** - `node test-login-api.js`
3. **Test frontend login** - Open login page and test
4. **Verify dashboard access** - Confirm user can access dashboard
