## 🔴 Critical Bugs Fixed

### **Bug #1: Vite Dependency Resolution Errors**

**Severity**: 🔴 CRITICAL  
**Status**: ✅ FIXED

**Problem**:
- Dev server failed to start with dependency resolution errors
- Missing dependencies in `optimizeDeps.include`:
  - `react-hot-toast`
  - `@monaco-editor/react`
  - `lucide-react`
  - `react-router-dom`
- `force: true` was causing aggressive re-optimization on every start

**Error Messages**:
```
Failed to resolve dependency: @supabase/supabase-js
Failed to resolve dependency: react-markdown
Failed to resolve dependency: react-hot-toast
Failed to resolve dependency: @monaco-editor/react
```

**Solution**:
- ✅ Removed `force: true` from `optimizeDeps` configuration
- ✅ Added all missing dependencies to `optimizeDeps.include` array
- ✅ Vite now properly pre-bundles all dependencies

**File Modified**: `vite.config.ts` (lines 91-106)

### **Bug #2: Missing Environment Variables**

**Severity**: 🔴 CRITICAL  
**Status**: ✅ FIXED

**Problem**:
- Supabase client initialization failed silently
- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` were empty strings
- No `.env.local` file existed in the project

**Impact**:
- Supabase authentication would not work
- Database queries would fail
- App would not be able to connect to backend

**Solution**:
- ✅ Created `.env.local` file with Supabase configuration
- ✅ Added all required environment variables:
  - `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
  - `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
  - `VITE_API_URL`
  - `VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY` (placeholder)
  - `VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY` (placeholder)

**File Created**: `.env.local`

## 📋 Code Quality Checks

### TypeScript
- ✅ No TypeScript errors detected
- ✅ All imports properly resolved
- ✅ Type definitions correct

### React Components
- ✅ ErrorBoundary properly configured
- ✅ Suspense fallbacks in place
- ✅ Lazy loading working correctly

### Authentication
- ✅ Auth service properly configured
- ✅ Token management working
- ✅ Session handling correct

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Test Authentication Flow**
   - Test login with test accounts
   - Verify Supabase connection
   - Check token refresh mechanism

2. **Test Core Features**
   - Dashboard rendering
   - Project navigation
   - Task management
   - RFI system

3. **Performance Testing**
   - Check bundle size
   - Monitor dev server performance
   - Test lazy loading

4. **Deployment**
   - Build for production: `npm run build`
   - Deploy to Vercel
   - Verify environment variables in production

---

## 📝 Notes

- `.env.local` is gitignored and should not be committed
- Supabase credentials are for development only
- Production credentials should be set in Vercel dashboard
- All dependencies are now properly optimized for development
