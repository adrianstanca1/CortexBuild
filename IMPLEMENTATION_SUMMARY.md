## 📋 Priority 2: Performance Optimization (PLANNED)

### **Deliverables**

📋 **PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZATION_GUIDE.md** includes:

**Current State Analysis**
- Bundle size: 2.5 MB (uncompressed), 600 KB (gzipped)
- Largest chunks: vendor (582 KB), react-core (254 KB), pdf-tools (378 KB)
- Initial load: 3-5 seconds

**Optimization Strategies**
1. **Code Splitting** (30-40% savings)
   - Route-based splitting
   - Component-based splitting
   - Manual chunk configuration

2. **Lazy Loading** (10-15% savings)
   - Image optimization
   - Component lazy loading
   - Suspense boundaries

3. **Caching** (50-70% on repeat visits)
   - HTTP caching headers
   - Service Worker
   - Offline support

4. **Bundle Analysis**
   - Identify unused code
   - Remove unused dependencies
   - Replace heavy packages

**Target Metrics**
- Initial load: <2 seconds (40% improvement)
- Bundle size: <1.5 MB (40% reduction)
- Largest chunk: <200 KB (65% reduction)

**Implementation Roadmap**
- Phase 1: Code Splitting (Week 1)
- Phase 2: Lazy Loading (Week 2)
- Phase 3: Caching (Week 3)
- Phase 4: Optimization (Week 4)
