## 🚨 ISSUE: Cannot See Project Details

I've identified the potential issue and added multiple ways for you to access project details.

## 🛠️ FIXES IMPLEMENTED

### ✅ 1. Clickable Project Cards
- **Entire card is now clickable** - Click anywhere on a project card

### Step 3: Try Multiple Ways to Access Details

## 🔍 DEBUGGING STEPS

### If Still Not Working:

#### Check Browser Console
1. Open browser developer tools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Look for any error messages
4. You should see: "Loading project with ID: 1" when accessing details

#### Check Network Tab
1. Open Network tab in developer tools
2. Try clicking a project
3. Look for any failed requests

#### Check URL
- When you click a project, the URL should change to:
- `http://localhost:3000/dashboard/projects/1`

## 🎯 EXPECTED BEHAVIOR

### When Working Correctly:
1. **Click project** → URL changes to `/dashboard/projects/1`
2. **Loading state** → Shows skeleton loading for 0.8 seconds
3. **Project details** → Shows complete project information with tabs:
   - **Overview** - Project details, progress, budget analysis
   - **Tasks** - 6 construction tasks with status tracking
   - **Team** - Team member information
   - **Documents** - Document management (coming soon)

### Project Detail Page Should Show:
- **Header** - Back button, project name, client name, status badge
- **Tabs** - Overview, Tasks, Team, Documents
- **Overview Tab**:
  - Project description
  - Location and timeline
  - Progress bar (75% for project #1)
  - Budget analysis (£63,750 / £85,000)
  - Client information sidebar
- **Tasks Tab**:
  - 6 realistic construction tasks
  - Task status icons and progress
  - Priority badges
  - Time tracking

## 🚨 TROUBLESHOOTING

### If You See Errors:

#### Error: "Project not found"
- This means the routing is working but data loading failed
- Check console for errors

#### Error: Page won't load
- Check if the server is running on port 3000
- Try refreshing the page
- Check for JavaScript errors in console

#### Error: Blank page
- Check browser console for errors
- Try the direct test link first

### If Nothing Happens When Clicking:
1. **Check JavaScript** - Make sure JavaScript is enabled
2. **Try different browser** - Test in Chrome/Firefox
3. **Clear cache** - Hard refresh (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
4. **Check console** - Look for any error messages

## 🔧 MANUAL URL TEST

If clicking doesn't work, try typing these URLs directly:

```
http://localhost:3000/dashboard/projects/1
http://localhost:3000/dashboard/projects/2
http://localhost:3000/dashboard/projects/3
```

## 📞 WHAT TO REPORT

If still not working, please check:

1. **What happens when you click?** 
   - Nothing? Error? Page refresh?

2. **Console errors?**
   - Any red error messages in browser console?

3. **URL changes?**
   - Does the URL change when you click?

4. **Which method did you try?**
   - Test link? Card click? Button click?

## ✅ SUCCESS INDICATORS

You'll know it's working when:
- ✅ URL changes to `/dashboard/projects/1`
- ✅ Page shows loading skeleton briefly
- ✅ Project details appear with tabs
- ✅ You can see "Commercial Roofing - Main Street Office" details
- ✅ Tasks tab shows 6 construction tasks
- ✅ Progress bar shows 75% completion

## 🎉 EXPECTED RESULT

When working, you should see a **beautiful, detailed project page** with:
