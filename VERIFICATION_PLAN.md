## 🧪 Verification Tests I Will Execute

Once you confirm the Vercel configuration is complete, I will:

### Phase 1: API Endpoint Testing
1. Run `node test-login-api.js`
2. Verify response status is 200 (not 405 or 401)
3. Check response contains valid JWT token
4. Verify user data is returned correctly
5. Analyze any errors if present

### Phase 2: Frontend Login Testing
1. Open the frontend URL in browser
2. Navigate to login page
3. Enter test credentials
4. Submit login form
5. Monitor browser console for errors
6. Verify redirect to dashboard
7. Confirm user session is maintained

### Phase 3: Troubleshooting (if needed)
1. Analyze error messages
2. Check Vercel function logs
3. Verify environment variables are set correctly
4. Suggest fixes for any issues
5. Re-test after fixes
