## 🔧 Bugs Fixed

### **1. Vite Dependency Resolution Errors** ✅

**What was wrong**:
- Dev server failed to start
- Missing dependencies in optimization config
- Aggressive re-optimization causing slowdowns

**What was fixed**:
- Removed `force: true` from `optimizeDeps`
- Added 5 missing dependencies to include list:
  - `react-hot-toast`
  - `@monaco-editor/react`
  - `lucide-react`
  - `react-router-dom`
  - (plus existing ones)

**Result**: Dev server now starts in 884ms without errors ✅

### **2. Missing Environment Variables** ✅

**What was wrong**:
- No `.env.local` file in project
- Supabase client initialized with empty strings
- Authentication would fail silently

**What was fixed**:
- Created `.env.local` with all required variables
- Configured Supabase connection
- Added API and AI service placeholders

**Result**: Supabase client now properly initialized ✅
