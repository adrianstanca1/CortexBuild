### Potential Challenges

**Data Security:** The security of sensitive financial and project data is paramount. Our platform will be built with enterprise-grade encryption, granular access controls, and regular security audits to ensure data integrity and confidentiality.

**AI Training & Accuracy:** The reliability of our AI agents is crucial. The AI will be trained on a vast and diverse dataset of anonymized construction data. We will implement a "human-in-the-loop" system for verification, especially in the early stages, to ensure the accuracy of the AI's recommendations and to build user trust.

**User Adoption:** We understand that introducing an AI-driven system to non-technical users can be a challenge. To address this, we are designing the platform with a user-friendly, conversational AI interface and an intuitive design. We will also provide comprehensive training and support to help users embrace the full potential of the platform.
