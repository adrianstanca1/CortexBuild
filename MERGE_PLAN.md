# 🔀 MERGE PLAN - Phase 1 to Main

**Date:** October 31, 2025  
**Status:** ⚠️ **BRANCH DIVERGENCE DETECTED**

---

## ⚠️ **CURRENT SITUATION**

```
Local main:  32 commits ahead
Origin main: 141 commits ahead (different timeline)
Branch:      2025-10-31-ksub-65eda (our Phase 1 work)
```

**Issue:** 
- Main branches have diverged significantly
- Different development timelines
- Many conflicts would occur

---

## 🎯 **RECOMMENDED APPROACH**

### **Option 1: Create Pull Request** ⭐ RECOMMENDED

**Why:**
- Clean merge process
- Code review before integration
- CI/CD checks
- No local conflicts to resolve

**Steps:**
```bash
# Already done! Our branch is pushed:
# origin/2025-10-31-ksub-65eda

# Go to GitHub:
# 1. Create Pull Request
# 2. Review changes
# 3. Merge when ready
```

---

### **Option 2: Direct Merge (Force)**

**Warning:** This will rewrite history

```bash
git checkout main
git reset --hard origin/main
git checkout 2025-10-31-ksub-65eda
git checkout main
git merge 2025-10-31-ksub-65eda --no-ff
git push origin main --force-with-lease
```

**Not Recommended:** May lose commits from origin/main

---

### **Option 3: Cherry-pick Specific Commits**

**When:** You only want specific Phase 1 features

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main --rebase

# Cherry-pick Phase 1 commits
git cherry-pick 6ce1818..fc02502
```

## ✅ **WHAT TO DO NOW**

### **Best Practice:**

1. **Keep Phase 1 on its branch**

   - Stable and working ✅

2. **Create Pull Request on GitHub**
   - Go to: https://github.com/adrianstanca1/CortexBuild
   - Click "New Pull Request"

3. **Review and Merge via GitHub UI**

   - Use merge conflict resolution UI
   - CI/CD checks will run
