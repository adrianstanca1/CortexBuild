**Problem:** notification_preferences referenced users table, notifications referenced profiles table

**Solution Applied:**
```sql
ALTER TABLE notification_preferences 
DROP CONSTRAINT notification_preferences_user_id_fkey;

ALTER TABLE notification_preferences 
ADD CONSTRAINT notification_preferences_user_id_fkey 
FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES profiles(id) ON DELETE CASCADE;
```

**Status:** ✅ FIXED

## 🎓 LESSONS LEARNED

1. **Schema Consistency:** Always ensure foreign key relationships are consistent across related tables
2. **RLS Policies:** Implement RLS early to ensure data security from the start
3. **Real-time Subscriptions:** Supabase real-time is powerful but requires proper channel setup
4. **Component Integration:** Plan integration points early to avoid refactoring
