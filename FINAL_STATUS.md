## 🐛 ISSUES RESOLVED

### 1. ✅ My Applications API Schema Issue (FIXED)
**Problem:** `SqliteError: no such column: sa.config`  
**Solution:** Removed `sa.config` from SQL queries  
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED  
**Commit:** e68deec

**Test Results:**
```bash
✅ Login: PASS
✅ My Applications API: PASS
   Response: {"success": true, "apps": [], "total": 0}
```

### 2. ✅ API URL Configuration (FIXED)
**Problem:** Frontend making requests to wrong URL  
**Solution:** Updated `.env.local` with correct API URL  
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED  
**Commit:** 1d4f388

**Before:**
```bash
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3001
```

**After:**
```bash
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3001/api
```

### 3. ✅ React Hooks in UnifiedDashboardScreen (FIXED)
**Problem:** Conditional useState calls  
**Solution:** Created SuperAdminDashboardWrapper component  
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED  
**Commit:** d6fd380

## ⚠️ KNOWN ISSUES

### 1. React Hooks Error (INTERMITTENT - LOW PRIORITY)
**Error:** "Rendered more hooks than during the previous render"  
**Frequency:** Intermittent - doesn't always reproduce  
**Impact:** Low - application functions correctly  
**Workaround:** Refresh page  
**Status:** 🔍 INVESTIGATING

**Analysis:**
- All hooks in App.tsx are called unconditionally ✅
- All hooks in dashboard components are called unconditionally ✅
- UnifiedDashboardScreen has been fixed ✅
- Likely caused by a lazy-loaded component or third-party library

**Next Steps:**
- Add more detailed error logging
- Check all lazy-loaded components
- Verify component render order
- Add error boundaries
