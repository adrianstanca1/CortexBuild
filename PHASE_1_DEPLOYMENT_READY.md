SELECT COUNT(*) FROM notification_preferences;

# Verify RLS policies
SELECT * FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename IN ('notifications', 'notification_preferences');
```

### Step 2: Deploy to Vercel
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Phase 1 Real-time Notifications System - Production Ready"
git push origin main
```

### Step 3: Monitor Deployment
- Check Vercel deployment status
- Verify build completes successfully
- Monitor error logs for any issues

### Step 4: Post-Deployment Testing
1. Open application in browser
2. Navigate to header (NotificationBell visible)
3. Navigate to Settings â†’ Notifications tab
4. Verify preferences load correctly
5. Create test notification in Supabase
6. Verify notification appears in real-time
