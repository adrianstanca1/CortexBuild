## ✨ What Happens Next

After you add these variables and redeploy:

1. ✅ Vercel will rebuild your project with the environment variables
2. ✅ The `/api/auth/login` endpoint will have access to Supabase
3. ✅ The API will be able to authenticate users
4. ✅ The frontend login will work end-to-end

## 📝 Important Reminders

⚠️ **Security:**
- SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY is sensitive
- Keep it secure
- Never share publicly
- Never commit to version control

✅ **Environments:**
- Always select ALL THREE environments
- This ensures the variables work in all deployment contexts

🔄 **Redeployment:**
- Required for environment variables to take effect
- Vercel will automatically rebuild with the new variables
