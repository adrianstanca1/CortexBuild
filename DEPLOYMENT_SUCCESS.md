## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: One More Step Required

### Run the Database Migration

The database tables haven't been created yet. You need to:

1. Go to <https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/qglvhxkgbzujglehewsa/sql/new>
2. Copy the entire contents of `supabase/migrations/marketplace_apps_schema.sql`
3. Paste into the SQL editor
4. Click "Run"

This will create all 7 tables with RLS policies.

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### Step 1: Run the Migration (see above)

### Step 2: Test TodoListApp

1. Open the preview URL: <https://constructai-5-hgi0zi33i-adrian-b7e84541.vercel.app>
2. Log in with test account:
   - Email: `super@admin.com`
   - Password: `admin123`
3. Navigate to "My Applications" desktop
4. Launch "Todo List" app
5. Add a few todos
6. **Refresh the page**
7. Open Todo List again
8. ✅ **Verify todos persist!**

### Expected Behavior

- ✅ Todos should load from Supabase
- ✅ Adding todos should save to database
- ✅ Toggling completion should update database
- ✅ Deleting todos should remove from database
- ✅ Data persists across page refreshes

### If It Doesn't Work

1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify migration was run successfully
3. Check Supabase Dashboard > Table Editor to see if tables exist
4. Verify RLS policies are enabled

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Option A: Complete Remaining Apps (Recommended)

Continue updating the other 5 marketplace apps with Supabase persistence. This will take ~2 hours and give users full data persistence across all apps.

### Option B: Build Daily Site Inspector

Jump to building the construction field app with camera integration, GPS tagging, and PDF reports. This will take ~3 hours.

### Option C: Test & Iterate

Test the TodoListApp thoroughly, gather feedback, and make improvements before continuing with other apps.
