## 🧪 Testing Phases

### Phase 1: API Endpoint Testing ✅
When you confirm, I will:
- Run `node test-login-api.js`
- Verify HTTP 200 response
- Check for valid JWT token
- Verify user data returned
- Analyze any errors

**Expected Result:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Login successful",
  "token": "eyJ...",
  "user": {
    "email": "adrian.stanca1@gmail.com",
    "name": "Adrian Stanca",
    "role": "admin"
  }
}
```

### Phase 2: Frontend Login Testing ✅
If API test passes, I will guide you through:
- Opening the frontend URL
- Entering test credentials
- Submitting the login form
- Verifying dashboard access
- Confirming user session

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ Login form submits successfully
- ✅ No console errors
- ✅ Redirected to dashboard
- ✅ User info displayed
- ✅ Can navigate dashboard

### Phase 3: Troubleshooting ✅
If any errors occur, I will:
- Analyze error messages
- Check Vercel function logs
- Verify environment variables
- Suggest fixes
- Re-test after fixes
