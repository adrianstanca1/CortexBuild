## üéØ Recommended Approach

### Option A: Agile Sprints (Recommended)
- **Sprint Length:** 2 weeks
- **Sprint 1-2:** Phase 1 (Foundation)
- **Sprint 3-4:** Phase 2 (Core Features)
- **Sprint 5-6:** Phase 3 (Financial & Safety)
- **Sprint 7-8:** Phase 4 (AI Features)
- **Sprint 9+:** Phase 5-6 (Advanced)

### Option B: Feature-First
- Pick one feature/module
- Build it completely end-to-end
- Test thoroughly
- Move to next feature
- Repeat

### Option C: MVP First
- Focus only on critical features
- Get to working product fast
- Launch early
- Iterate based on feedback

## üöÄ Let's Start!

**Immediate Next Step:**
1. Fix the authentication/infinite loop issue
2. Get login working 100%
3. Test all 21 views to see status
4. Create detailed task list for Phase 1

**Should I:**
- A) Start with Phase 1 (Fix critical issues)?
- B) Create detailed tasks for first sprint?
- C) Audit all components to see completion status?
- D) Something else?
